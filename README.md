## Our Concept
For the average consumer it is currently too difficult to invest in sustainable house upgrades. Mapping out your house to find potential weakspots in your house's insulation is a pricey endeavor. Our app strives to remove that obstacle almost entirely, by allowing homeowners to analyze their property by themselves without the need of a consultant.

## Contents
The repository contains an artists impression of our concept app. And a python script which demonstrates how the backend of the app would function.
